CricStarter is a website that provides free tips, techniques, and guidelines to people who love cricket and want to get better at it. In India,cricket is like a religion, and we want to help individuals who have a passion for the game to improve their skills.

In India, we often see that we win only a few medals in the Olympics, while other countries like the USA and China win hundreds. This is because our players do not receive the same level of training, guidance, and equipment as athletes in other countries. This problem exists not just in cricket, but in every sport in India.

In many remote areas of the country, there are no sports committees or organizations to help players develop their skills. This is a major reason why many people who have a passion and talent for sports cannot pursue it as a career.

At CricStarter, we want to change this scenario by providing free and proper cricketing skills, guidance, tips, and techniques to players. Our platform is available online, which means that individuals from remote areas can also access it and get the guidance they need. Our aim is to ensure that every talented cricket player in India has the opportunity to succeed and achieve their dreams.
